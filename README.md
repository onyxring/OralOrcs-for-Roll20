# The ORAL ORCS framework for Roll20  

ORAL ORCS is a framework for Roll20, comprised of two pieces: the “OnyxRing API Library” (ORAL) and the “OnyxRing Client Script” (ORCS). Like most frameworks, much of ORAL ORCS is an abstraction of underlying services. It adds support for modern features of the JavaScript language and simplifies Roll20 development. With it, code is easier to write, easier to read, and easier to understand. You can do more, with less.

The lion's share of the documentation for this framework is embedded in the ORALORCS.pdf file.
